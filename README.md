# 🏗 GTNFT

🎨 GTNFT NFT contract shows how to generate dynamic SVG NFTs entirely on-chain using deterministic randomness, dynamic pricing, and real-time SVG generation.

A fully-on-chain SVG NFT puts both the artwork and its metadata directly onto the blockchain, guaranteeing that the image can be reconstructed forever without IPFS or web servers.
